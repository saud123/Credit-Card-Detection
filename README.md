# 🔍 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques on an imbalanced dataset.

## 📄 Project Overview
- Built using Python and Jupyter Notebook
- Dataset contains anonymized features for over 280,000 transactions
- Fraud cases are rare (highly imbalanced)

## 🧠 Key Steps
- Data preprocessing and exploration (handling missing values, scaling)
- Addressed class imbalance using **SMOTE**
- Trained multiple models: **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost**
- Evaluated using metrics: **Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC**

## 📈 Results
- Identified the best-performing model with high recall on fraud cases
- Used confusion matrix and ROC curves for validation

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SMOTE
